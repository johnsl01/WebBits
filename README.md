# WebBits

This is a 'hold all' repository where I put code snippets that I spot on the web (stack overflow etc) 
and I want to look at more closely.

In general I delete things here when I have used them elsewhere, or when I have given up on them.

Assume nothing here actually works - and assume that nothing here is an optimum or even an appropriate 
solution to whatever problem it is addressing.

---------------

Test01.ipynb is an ipython/jupiter style notebook (colab variety - apparently slightly different)

Which can be opened in google colab 
at :
