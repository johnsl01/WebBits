# WebBits

This is a 'hold all' repository where I put code snippets that I spot on the web (stack overflow etc) and I want to look at more closely.

In general I delete thibgs here when I have used them elsewhere, or when I have given up on them.

Assume nothing here actually works - and assume that nothing here is a an optimum or even an appropriate solution to whatever problem it is addressing.
